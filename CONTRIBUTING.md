# Contributing to Covenant

Covenant is licensed under CC-BY 4.0. You are free to read, share, and adapt this specification for any purpose, including commercial use, provided you give appropriate credit and indicate if changes were made.

Implementations are not derivative works. Building a system that implements Covenant — in any language, for any purpose, under any license — does not create CC-BY obligations on your implementation code. You own your implementation.

When attributing, we recommend identifying the specific version: "Based on Covenant v0.3.0" is more useful than "Based on Covenant" for compatibility tracing.
